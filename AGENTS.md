# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository is designed for production-quality AI/ML/quant research systems.

All coding agents must optimize for:

- maintainability
- modularity
- reproducibility
- testability
- documentation quality
- scientific rigor
- future extensibility

The repository should always be maintainable by another engineer without requiring tribal knowledge.

# Core Engineering Rules

## Architecture

All projects must follow modular separation.

With every major change, agents must analyze the whole project and proactively identify and implement maintainability, quality, and extensibility improvements where appropriate.

```text
project/
|-- ingestion/
|-- preprocessing/
|-- modeling/
|-- evaluation/
|-- api/
|-- infra/
|-- notebooks/
|-- tests/
|-- docs/
|-- README.md
|-- REPORT.md
`-- AGENTS.md
```

Rules:

- Keep modules isolated
- Use explicit interfaces
- Avoid large monolithic scripts
- Separate experimental notebooks from production code
- Move reusable notebook logic into Python modules
- Code must be structured according to optimal software design patterns for the use case (for example clear layering, separation of concerns, dependency inversion where appropriate, and composable modules).
- Design choices must prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

## Scalability-First Decision Policy

All technical decisions must explicitly account for future data growth, including:

- more dataset types
- more symbols
- more exchanges
- higher ingestion frequency and larger historical backfills

Required engineering implications:

- Prefer incremental/delta processing over repeated full rescans.
- Keep processing partition-aware and idempotent.
- Use bounded, configurable concurrency (avoid unbounded fan-out).
- Ensure schema evolution is backward compatible and versioned.
- Keep exchange/dataset integrations modular through explicit adapter interfaces.
- Preserve observability for scale operations (progress, throughput, error isolation).
- Favor storage and indexing strategies that remain efficient as volume grows.

## Timeframe Scope Policy (MANDATORY)

The ingestion scope is restricted to **1m timeframe only**.

Rules:

- Agents must configure and run ingestion commands using only `1m`/`M1`.
- Agents must not introduce or persist `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, or other non-`1m` ingestion flows unless the user explicitly changes this policy.
- When updating docs, examples, cronjobs, or operational scripts, default and recommended ingest timeframe must remain `1m`.

---

# Code Quality Rules

## Mandatory Type Safety

- Use type hints everywhere
- Functions must have explicit return types

## Documentation

- All functions require docstrings
- Public classes require usage examples

## Formatting

Code must remain compatible with:

- ruff
- mypy
- pytest

---

# Testing Rules

After every meaningful code change:

```bash
pytest
```

For linting:

```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
```

Pre-commit hooks must automatically run:

- tests
- lint checks
- formatting checks

---

# Git Hygiene Rules

The repository must never track local-only development folders or cache folders.

Always ignore and keep untracked:

- `.venv/`
- `.vscode/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `.pytest_cache/`
- `.mypy_cache/`
- `.ruff_cache/`
- `.cache/`
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`
- `.env`
- `.env.*` (except `.env.example`)

If any of these paths are accidentally tracked, agents must remove them from git tracking using cached removal (keep local files), then confirm `.gitignore` contains the proper exclusions.

## Commit Message Rules (MANDATORY)

All commits must use Conventional Commits format.

Required structure:

```text
type(scope): short summary
```

Allowed `type` values:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `refactor`
- `test`
- `docs`
- `chore`
- `ci`
- `build`
- `perf`

Rules:

- Commit messages that do not follow Conventional Commits are not allowed.
- Summary must be concise and written in imperative mood.
- Use `scope` for module/domain when possible (for example `ingestion`, `api`, `tests`, `docs`).

Examples:

- `feat(ingestion): add bybit spot and perp kline adapter`
- `fix(api): run fetch tasks sequentially for all-history stability`
- `test(spot): cover bybit market routing`

---

# Security Rules

- Never expose secrets
- Never commit credentials
- Never expose API keys
- Use environment variables
- Use `.env.example`
- Never place `export KEY=VALUE` blocks in `README.md` or `REPORT.md`.
- Put runtime environment variables in the default local config file (for example `.env`), and ensure that file is excluded from git tracking.
- Sensitive information (passwords, tokens, private keys, connection strings) must be stored only in local config files or environment files that are excluded from git tracking.
- Local config files that may contain sensitive values must always be listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.

---

# README.md Requirements

README.md must function as a complete technical wiki.

It must always include:

- project overview
- architecture diagram
- installation guide
- dependency setup
- module explanations
- execution workflow
- testing instructions
- deployment instructions
- known limitations
- future improvements
- architecture and storage tradeoff decisions with rationale (for example why Parquet/object storage and alternatives considered)

Use nested sections.

Use ASCII diagrams where helpful.

Example:

```text
PDF -> Parser -> Chunker -> Embeddings -> Vector Store -> Retrieval -> LLM
```

README must always remain updated after major architectural changes.

---

# REPORT.md Requirements (MANDATORY FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS)

Every research-heavy repository must maintain an additional `REPORT.md`.

This file represents the scientific paper / empirical research report.

Agents must automatically update REPORT.md whenever:

- experiments change
- model architecture changes
- evaluation metrics change
- datasets change
- new findings emerge

## REPORT Evidence Source Policy

For `REPORT.md` figures, plots, and statistics:

- If relevant notebooks exist in the repository, agents must use notebook-derived outputs as the primary source.
- If required plots/statistics are not available in existing notebooks, agents must generate them and include them in the report.
- Agents should clearly state whether each key reported result comes from notebook outputs or was generated by the agent.
- Figures referenced in `REPORT.md` must be embedded as visible images (not text-only references).
- When notebook plots exist, agents should export or capture those notebook plot outputs into versioned files (for example under `docs/figures/notebook_outputs/`) and link them with relative Markdown image paths.
- If notebook plots do not exist for required report figures, agents must generate the plots, save image files in the repo, and embed them in `REPORT.md`.
