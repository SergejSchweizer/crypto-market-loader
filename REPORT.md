# Deribit Market Data Ingestion Baseline for Crypto Research Pipelines

## Abstract
This report presents a production-oriented baseline for cryptocurrency market-data ingestion designed to support downstream quantitative research. The problem addressed is the lack of reproducible, maintainable ingestion layers in early-stage quant projects, where exchange-specific scripts and schema drift frequently undermine empirical validity. We implement a typed, modular ingestion pipeline with adapter abstractions for Deribit, command-line interfaces for deterministic execution, and partitioned parquet-lake storage. Data are sourced from public exchange REST endpoints and normalized into canonical OHLCV, open-interest, and funding schemas with metadata fields for run traceability. The main finding is engineering-focused: the system provides deterministic normalization, supports backward pagination and gap-fill synchronization for historical series, preserves raw source event timestamps for OI and funding, and preserves idempotent persistence via natural-key partition merges. The current codebase also includes a silver-to-gold per-symbol build path that combines spot/perp/OI/funding silver features into one hashed gold artifact with symbol-level manifest metadata. The contribution is a maintainable ingestion foundation suitable for subsequent market microstructure, regime, and forecasting studies, with explicit reproducibility controls (strict typing, tests, linting, config-driven runs, and stable execution commands).

Canonical data-type naming in this project is fixed as `spot`, `perp`, `oi`, and `funding` across CLI and code. The parquet storage label for OI raw rows is `dataset_type=oi`. OHLCV is `1m`; OI and funding are stored at raw event timestamps.

## Introduction
Reliable market-data ingestion is a prerequisite for valid quantitative inference in crypto research.

Many practical pipelines fail due to exchange-specific one-off scripts, inconsistent timestamp handling, and weak reproducibility controls.

This project proposes a modular ingestion architecture with typed interfaces, explicit normalization, and reproducible command-line workflows focused on Deribit as the current production exchange.

The contributions of this stage are: (1) Deribit `spot`, `perp`, `oi`, and `funding` normalization for BTC/ETH/SOL, (2) parquet-lake persistence paths, (3) tested operational workflows for repeatable data acquisition.

## Literature Review
Volatility clustering and regime dependence motivate robust historical market-data pipelines. ARCH/GARCH foundations establish heteroskedastic behavior in financial time series, requiring high-integrity timestamped observations (Engle, 1982; Bollerslev, 1986). Regime-switching frameworks further highlight sensitivity to data quality and temporal consistency (Hamilton, 1989). Later work on high-frequency econometrics and realized-volatility estimation reinforces the need for reliable, granular data ingestion and synchronization processes (Andersen et al., 2001; Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, 2002).
Market microstructure and stylized-facts literature also emphasizes heavy tails, volatility clustering, and serial dependence in returns, which makes interval alignment and timestamp integrity central to defensible inference (Cont, 2001).

Within crypto-specific empirical work, market microstructure studies and liquidity fragmentation analyses depend on exchange-consistent symbol and timeframe normalization. This baseline currently covers BTC/ETH/SOL symbol normalization on Deribit and does not yet estimate econometric models, but it is intentionally built to satisfy upstream data-quality assumptions for such methods.

## Dataset
- Source: Deribit `/api/v2/public/get_tradingview_chart_data`, `/api/v2/public/get_last_settlements_by_instrument`, `/api/v2/public/get_funding_rate_history`.
- Sample period: user-configurable runtime period determined by symbols, markets, and existing parquet coverage; OHLCV is stored at `1m` while OI/funding preserve raw source event timestamps.
- Number of observations: runtime-dependent on symbol/timeframe scope and auto bootstrap vs gap-fill behavior.
- Variables: `open_time`, `close_time`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, `quote_volume`, `trade_count` plus provenance metadata.
- Additional perp feature set: `open_interest`, `open_interest_value`, and funding-rate fields.
- Cleaning methodology: exchange adapter normalization, timeframe validation, symbol normalization, UTC conversion, partition-level deduplication by natural key.
- Train/test split: not applicable at ingestion-only stage.

### Data Type Definitions, Rationale, And Meaning

#### `spot`
- Why it exists in this research artifact:
  `spot` provides the baseline cash-market price process required for primary return and volatility measurement.
- Meaning in analysis:
  Exchange-executed cash OHLCV bars; these are the reference series for non-derivative market state.

#### `perp`
- Why it exists in this research artifact:
  `perp` captures derivatives-market trading behavior that can differ from spot and add information about speculative flow.
- Meaning in analysis:
  Perpetual-futures OHLCV bars normalized to the same schema as `spot`, enabling direct cross-market comparisons.

#### `oi`
- Why it exists in this research artifact:
  `oi` is needed to quantify aggregate open positioning, which is not observable from OHLCV alone.
- Meaning in analysis:
  Open-interest time series associated with perpetual instruments; used to interpret whether moves are supported by position expansion or contraction.

### Dataset Variable Construction (Implementation-Aligned)

#### `spot` (cash OHLCV)
- Constructed fields:
  `open_time`, `close_time`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, `quote_volume`, `trade_count`.
- Field construction logic:
  - `open_time` is exchange open timestamp converted to UTC datetime.
  - `close_time` is either exchange-provided close timestamp or computed as `open_time + timeframe_ms - 1` for endpoints that publish only interval starts.
  - `open/high/low/close` are direct float-casts of exchange candle values.
  - `volume` is base-asset traded volume over interval.
  - `quote_volume` is exchange quote-turnover field when available; otherwise stored as `null` (Deribit chart endpoint does not provide dedicated quote turnover in the mapped payload).
  - `trade_count` is exchange trade-count field when available; otherwise set to `0`.

#### `perp` (perpetual OHLCV)
- Constructed fields:
  Same canonical OHLCV schema as `spot`; this enables direct cross-market comparisons without extra schema transforms.
- Field construction logic:
  - Same parser and storage mapping as `spot` (`SpotCandle` normalization path).
  - Symbol normalization is exchange/market specific before parse (for example Deribit `BTC` -> `BTC-PERPETUAL`).

#### `oi` (perpetual open interest)
- Constructed fields:
  `open_time`, `close_time`, `open_interest`, `open_interest_value`.
- Field construction logic:
  - OI ingestion is gated to `perp` context; non-perp requests return empty results by design.
  - `open_time` derives from exchange timestamp and is UTC-normalized.
  - `close_time` equals `open_time` in bronze raw mode.
  - `open_interest` is mapped from exchange OI position-size field.
  - `open_interest_value` is populated when the source returns a notional/value metric; else `0.0`.
  - Exchange-specific mapping:
  - Deribit: settlement `timestamp` is preserved as event time; `open_interest <- position`, `open_interest_value <- 0.0`.

## Methodology
### System Design
```text
CLI -> Application Service Layer (gapfill_service, fetch_service)
    -> Adapter Layer -> HTTP Client -> Exchange REST APIs
    -> Normalized SpotCandle/OpenInterestPoint -> Parquet Lake
```

Storage and artifact side effects are also routed through dedicated services (`storage_service`, `artifact_service`) to keep CLI logic thin and testable. Canonical CLI-to-storage naming (`spot`/`perp`/`funding` direct  + `oi -> dataset_type=oi`) is formalized in `application/schema.py`.

### Core Mapping
For each candle index \(t\):

\[
x_t = \{e, s, \Delta, \tau_t^{open}, \tau_t^{close}, o_t, h_t, l_t, c_t, v_t, qv_t, n_t\}
\]

where \(e\) is exchange, \(s\) symbol, \(\Delta\) timeframe, and \(n_t\) trade count.

### Persistence Objective
Rows are persisted with natural key:

\[
K = (exchange, instrument\_type, symbol, timeframe, open\_time)
\]

Upsert policy enforces idempotency:

\[
\text{row}_{new}(K) \leftarrow \text{row}_{incoming}(K)
\]

### Optimization Logic
- Bronze build operates in exactly two modes:
  1. `fetch all history` for symbol/timeframe partitions that do not yet exist in parquet.
  2. `fill gaps` for existing partitions by recovering missing internal intervals and tail intervals.
- Bounded HTTP retries with exponential backoff for transient failures (default runtime profile: timeout `8s`, retries `2`, backoff `0.5s`).
- Pagination for exchange request limits.
- Gap-fill computes missing intervals from stored open-time sets.
- Fetch execution uses bounded concurrency with task-level isolation.
- Time-range fetches are split into UTC day windows and processed in randomized order.
- Fetch orchestration and task error isolation are handled in a dedicated service layer (`application/services/fetch_service.py`) rather than directly in CLI command code.
- Parquet reads/writes process data in batches to bound memory usage.

## Results
This stage reports ingestion robustness and descriptive statistics; bronze sample generation is CSV-only.

## Discussion
Business implications: a reliable ingestion substrate lowers operational risk for strategy research and accelerates feature engineering, backtesting, and monitoring deployment.

Limitations: current scope includes OHLCV, open-interest, and funding, but not trade-level feeds. Exchange-specific outages and schema changes still require active maintenance.

Model weaknesses/assumptions: this stage does not perform inference; assumptions are engineering assumptions (timestamp consistency, endpoint availability, and exchange-provided data correctness).

## Conclusion
This baseline establishes a reproducible and extensible ingestion pipeline for Deribit crypto market data with typed normalization and idempotent persistence. The immediate value is production-quality data plumbing for future empirical studies. Next steps are fixed experiment configs, notebook-to-report metrics automation, and model/evaluation modules with formal benchmarks.
